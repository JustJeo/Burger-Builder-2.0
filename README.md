# Burger Builder 2.0

Have you ever wanted to get a small glimpse of what it was like behind the scenes of your favorite burger restaurant? With Burger Builder you're able to take the role of the person making the orders! Play this fast paced game from the bottom up and get the highest score you can get! But be accurate! Every correctly made burger will reward you points but every wrong burger will lose you points!

## Motivation
I have officially graduated from my coding bootcamp and wanted to refactor my very first project into a DRY code that would be easier for a coder to look at.

## How To Play!
Players have 1 minute to build as many burgers from the bottom up. With every burger sent, it will be compared to the customer's order and perfectly matching burgers will gain players 50 points while incorrect burgers will lose 100 points.

## User Stories/Game Logic
- Players will click the starting button to active a 1 minute timer.
- A burger name will be displayed along with the recipe on how to make the burger.
- Players must construct the order from the bottom up (starting with the bottom bun).
- When players are done replicating the order, they push the "Order Up!" button which submits the burger to be checked.
- With every matching burger, players will receive 50 points.
- Every wrong burger will cost players 100 points.
- The user's score gets update automatically.
- After clicking the "Order Up!" button, the building area will reset and a new order appears for the player to create.
- After 1 minute, the option to send an order in will be disabled and text will display how the player did.
- If a user has gotten a highscore, the highscore will replace the recently recorded old score.

## Wireframing/Pre-Coding and Planning
During the pre-coding stage I had originally planned everything out on my Samsung Note 9 and hand wrote a small visualization of what I thought the game should look like!

## Code Snippets
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- This code consists of many functions, lots and lots of functions. I have also included a randomizer and arrays. The main functionality of the game is an object with arrays and functions all nestled into it.
- There is no back-end work to this project

## Credit
A lot of my function creations came from small snippets of past homework and lectures from my GA SEI-R Program. I compared my timer to that of the timer code from a "Poke-A-Square", I understood the logic of having empty arrays by taking glances at the "High-Card" deliverable, and a lot CSS was taken into consideration from the lesson from the week before.

Any super questionable moments in my code were solved with reaching out to the instructors and using 
- MDN
- overstack flow
- w3schools 
websites of a wide variety.

Of course I have to give credit to the party room where I was able to meet up with classmates everyday for project week and we helped each other out with our codes. Though we were working on different games we were still able to do our best to help out.

I also want to thank my significant other for keeping me sane and pushing me to keep going and to not give up.

## Future Development
What are the next steps for this project?
- I want to possibly make spin-off versions of this game. The world has so many different types of food, why only stop at burgers? I have been thinking of a sushi maker, a taco constructor, and everything in between.
